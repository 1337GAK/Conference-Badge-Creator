Conference Badge Creator

Conference Badge Creator is a CLI tool written in Python 2.7. Although it can be used for wider purposes, it aims to automate the process of mass-creating the badge for any event of your liking. It takes an Excel File with the Names/Surnames/Occupations of the attendees (customiazable) and the template badge as input. After minimal amount of time it generates a folder in your current working directory with a name of your liking and saves the badges depending on the attendees occupation.
e.g
Foo Bar Speaker
Foo1 Bar1 Volunteer
Foo2 Bar2 Random
Each one of the Foo Bar's will have his own folder along with other people who share the same occupation with them. This is done in order to ease the organizing of the badges post-print. How many times have you been in a conference where people couldn't find your badge instantly or even required to handwrite your name on it, even though you registered online?
